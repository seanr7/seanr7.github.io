My name is **Sean Reiter**. I am a **Courant Instructor** with the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University. There, I am working in the research group of Dr. Benjamin Peherstorfer on problems in model reduction, data assimilation, and scientific machine learning. 

Prior to NYU, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematics at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA, USA in the Spring of 2025. There, I was jointly supervised by Dr. Mark Embree and Dr. Serkan Gugercin, and worked on various problems in the model reduction, data-driven reduced modeling,and real-time monitoring of large-scale and structured dynamical systems. Prior to that, I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees, also from Virginia Tech, and was a Givens Associate in the Mathematical and Computational Sciences division of Argonne National Laboratory.
