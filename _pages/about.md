My name is **Sean Reiter**. I am a **Courant Instructor** with the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University. There, I am working in the research group of Dr. Benjamin Peherstorfer on problems in model reduction, data assimilation, and scientific machine learning. 

Prior to NYU, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematics at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA, USA in the Spring of 2025. There, I was jointly supervised by Dr. Mark Embree and Dr. Serkan Gugercin. My dissertation considered various problems of approximation in structured and large-scale dynamical systems. Specific foci included system-theoretic model-order reduction, data-driven reduced-order modeling of structured and mechanical systems, and data-based methods for the real-time monitoring of electrical power networks.

Prior to that, I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees, also from Virginia Tech, and was a Givens Associate in the Mathematical and Computational Sciences division of Argonne National Laboratory.
