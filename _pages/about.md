My name is **Sean Reiter** and I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in the department of mathematics at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg VA, USA, under the supervision of Dr. Mark Embree and Dr. Serkan Gugercin. Broadly, my research interests center around system- and control-theoretic methods for model-order reduction, data-driven modeling, and real-time monitoring of large-scale and structured dynamical systems.

I obtained my M.S. in Mathematics from Virginia Tech in December 2021, and my B.S. in Mathematics with a minor in chemistry from Virginia Tech in May 2018. I was Givens Associate at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont IL, USA, during the Summers of 2022 and 2023 under the supervision of Dr. Swann Perarnau and Dr. Thomas Applencourt.
