My name is **Sean Reiter**, and I am a Courant Instructor with the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University. There, I am working in the research group of Dr. Benjamin Peherstorfer on problems in model reduction, data assimilation, and scientific machine learning. 

I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematics at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA, USA, where I was jointly supervised by Dr. Mark Embree and Dr. Serkan Gugercin. Prior to that, I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees, also from Virginia Tech, and was a Givens Associate in the Mathematical and Computational Sciences division of Argonne National Laboratory.
